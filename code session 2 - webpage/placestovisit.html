                            The castle was built between 1171 and 1187 on the site of the Roman fort of Lavatris, sitting in a field surrounded by a moat on two sides. It was built to guard the route known as the Stainmore Pass and was occupied from the last 1st century to the late 4th century. The keep is the only part of the castle that remained, which was built by Henry II, who recognised the route's importance and its crucial defensive position.
